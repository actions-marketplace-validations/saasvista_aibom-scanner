# Changelog

## 1.2.0 (2026-07-21)

.NET detection depth.

1.1.0 taught the scanner to open `.cs`/`.fs`/`.vb` files; it still could not
understand them. 28 of the existing patterns are import-shaped (`from x`,
`import x`, `require('x')`) and none matched a C# `using` directive, and no NuGet
manifest format was parsed. Measured on `OneIdentity/safeguard-mcp`: 1 detection
across 13,689 lines of C#, and zero dependencies, despite the repo declaring
`ModelContextProtocol 1.4.0` in its `.csproj` and using it in 12 source files.

### Added

- **C# `using`-directive patterns.** 9 new patterns covering `ModelContextProtocol`
  (including the `[McpServerTool]` / `[McpServerResource]` attribute family),
  `Microsoft.SemanticKernel`, `Azure.AI.OpenAI`, `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`,
  `Amazon.BedrockRuntime`, `Google.Cloud.AIPlatform`, and `Mscc.GenerativeAI`.
  Every pattern is anchored to line start and requires a PascalCase namespace, so
  `using`-as-resource-disposal (`using var client = ...`, `using (var stream = ...)`)
  never triggers a false positive.
- **NuGet manifest parsing.** `.csproj`, `.fsproj`, `.vbproj`, `Directory.Packages.props`,
  and `packages.config` are now parsed for `PackageReference` / `PackageVersion` /
  `package` elements, matched against a new NuGet-specific package map
  (`NUGET_DEPENDENCY_MAP`) using longest dot-boundary prefix matching, so
  `Azure.AI.OpenAI` resolves to `azure_openai` and never collides with `openai`.
  Central package management's optional `Version` attribute is handled — a
  missing version does not drop the dependency. Manifests are parsed with regex,
  not an XML parser, and a malformed manifest degrades to no dependencies found
  rather than raising.
- These manifests are scannable but are not counted as source, exactly like
  `package.json` today — `coverage_pct` is unaffected by their presence.

### Result on the measured fixture

`OneIdentity/safeguard-mcp`: 1 detection / 0 dependencies before this release,
23 detections / 2 dependencies after, with `mcp` correctly surfaced as a detected
provider and `ModelContextProtocol` surfaced as a dependency.

## 1.1.0 (2026-07-21)

An accuracy release, correcting error in both directions.

An AI Bill of Materials that silently omits what it could not parse is not incomplete,
it is wrong. 1.0.0 under-reported by never opening whole languages, and over-reported
by inferring providers from local module names and from the AWS SDK. This release makes
every unread file visible, labels every evidence-free finding as such, and stops
attributing providers a repository does not use.

### Behavior change — `--severity-threshold`

**`--severity-threshold` now counts observed findings only.** In 1.0.0 the gate
counted every finding, including the 18 governance rules that fire on empty input,
so any repository tripped `--severity-threshold high` regardless of what was in it.
The flag was unusable: without it every scan exited 0 (false green), with it every
scan exited 1 (false red on fabricated findings).

If your CI relied on 1.0.0 always failing, it will now pass unless the scan actually
observed AI usage at or above the threshold. This is the intended fix.

This also repairs the **GitHub Action**, which passes `--severity-threshold` on every
run (default `high`). Under 1.0.0 three governance rules fired on every repository, so
the Action failed every build regardless of what the code contained. It is usable now.
The Action gains a `fail-on-incomplete-coverage` input.

### Added

- **Coverage accounting.** Every scan reports how much of the repo's source it read,
  with a denominator. Two ratios, because either alone misleads:
  `coverage_pct` (scanned / all source seen) and `readable_coverage_pct`
  (scanned / source we intended to read, i.e. excluding tests and fixtures).
- **`--fail-on-incomplete-coverage`** — opt-in, exits `3` when the scanner could not
  read some source languages. Off by default so existing CI does not break on upgrade.
- **Coverage warning on stderr** whenever languages were unreadable, in every output
  format. Written to stderr so it cannot corrupt piped JSON or SARIF.
- **`evidence_basis` on every finding** — `observed` (backed by something in the
  scanned source) or `inferred` (no evidence, no detected providers).
- Table output splits findings into "Observed in code" and
  "Governance checklist — not observed in code".
- SARIF carries coverage in `runs[0].properties` and `runs[0].invocations[0]`, plus a
  `toolExecutionNotification` when coverage is incomplete.
- New scannable extensions: `.cs`, `.fs`, `.vb`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.cjs`, `.sh`,
  `.swift`. A 243-file C# repository previously scanned 27 files and read zero `.cs`.

### Changed

- **SARIF emits only observed findings as results.** A governance checklist item is
  not a defect at a code location, and 1.0.0 pushed them into GitHub Code Scanning as
  authoritative alerts.
- Comment-led lines and asset imports (`import Logo from "anthropic.svg"`) no longer
  produce detections. Real usage — `import openai  # noqa`, `require("openai")`,
  `base_url="https://api.deepseek.com"` — is unaffected.

### Fixed — false-positive providers ([#2](https://github.com/saasvista/aibom-scanner/issues/2))

The same release that stops the scanner under-reporting also stops it over-reporting.

- **`replicate`, `together` and `cohere` import patterns are anchored to line start.**
  These provider names are common English words, so `from app.services import replicate`
  — a local module — was reported as Replicate.com usage. Any repository with a
  same-named module was mis-flagged. Top-level, indented, submodule and JavaScript
  `require()` imports are all still detected.
- **`boto3` no longer maps to `aws_bedrock`.** `boto3` is the entire AWS SDK, so its
  presence flagged Bedrock for any repository touching S3, SQS or DynamoDB. Bedrock is
  now detected from actual usage (`bedrock-runtime`, `bedrock.invoke_model`,
  `BedrockRuntime`), which was already specific and correct.

Thanks to [@nandanadileep](https://github.com/nandanadileep) ([#3](https://github.com/saasvista/aibom-scanner/pull/3)),
whose line-anchoring approach for `cohere` was the right shape and is incorporated here,
extended to the other two affected providers and the dependency mapping.

### Not in this release

Detection depth for the newly-readable languages (C# `using` directives, NuGet
manifest parsing) is a 1.2 concern. 1.1.0 reads `.cs` files and honestly reports
finding little, which is correct and a large improvement over not reading them.
